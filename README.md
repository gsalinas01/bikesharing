# NYC Citi Bike Data Analysis
## Overview:
  * The Tableau story can be found here: [Link to Story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/KRH2S2HFR?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
  * The purpose of this project was to analyze data from a NYC Bikesharing Company during the month of August in order to present the findings to potential investors looking to start a bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results:
  * The following data points were gathered from the analysis:

The screenshot below shows the breakdown of customers by gender and by subscriber status. More than half of all users are male and over 75% of users are subscribers to the NYC Citi Bike program.

This image shows the trip durations by hour of the day, which reflects a window of opportunity between 2AM and 5AM for bike repairs. Due to low usage of the bike service during this time, the company can take advantage in order to perform necessary maintenance and repairs.

The image below reflects trip start times and end times by location in NYC. Because the majority of trips start and end in the city, as opposed to the outskirts of the city, it may be wise to place bikes in more populous and high traffic areas in Des Moines.

This screenshot shows the number of trips by duration. Based on the graph, users tend to utilize bikes for less than an hour and typically closer to the 5-20 minute range.  Shorter trip durations are an important aspect of this business.

The image below reflects the number of rides by duration and gender. The graph makes it apparent that the majority of bike sharing users in NYC are of the male population.

## Summary:
  * The results of the data analysis provide insights as to what major factors to consider if investors choose to move forward with the project:
    * Population Density: Because the majority of bike trips started and ended in the most densely populated locations (areas of high tourism and scenic views), it might be wise to consider highly populated, touristic areas in Des Moines. 
    * Gender: The majority of bike trips were made by males, which provides opportunity to explore locations where members of the male population might frequent the most (gyms, bars, certain clubs). 
  * Additional visuals (suggestions):
    * An area to consider exploring is the number of trips by location and by gender, so as to find out what areas may consist of higher male vs female traffic and strategically place bikes in that manner. 
    * Another area of opportunity may be mapping out the number of trips by location and by age as younger populations tend to utilize the bike service far more than older populations.
