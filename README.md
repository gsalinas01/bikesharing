# NYC Citi Bike Data Analysis
## Overview:
  * The purpose of this project was to analyze data from a NYC Bikesharing Company during the month of August in order to present the findings to potential investors looking to start a bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results:
  * The following data points were gathered from the analysis:

## Summary:
  * The results of the data analysis provide insights as to what major factors to consider if investors choose to move forward with the project:
    * Population Density: Because the majority of bike trips started and ended in the most densely populated locations (areas of high tourism and scenic views), it might be wise to consider highly populated, touristic areas in Des Moines. 
    * Gender: The majority of bike trips were made by males, which provides opportunity to explore locations where members of the male population might frequent the most (gyms, bars, certain clubs). 
  * Additional visuals (suggestions):
    * An area to consider exploring is the number of trips by location and by gender, so as to find out what areas may consist of higher male vs female traffic and strategically place bikes in that manner. 
    * Another area of opportunity may be mapping out the number of trips by location and by age as younger populations tend to utilize the bike service far more than older populations.
